# Angular Starter Project

The goal of this starter app is to provide a simple way to get started with Angular 2+ while also implementing several key Angular features. The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## Angular Features

* Properly formed Core & Shared modules
* Add-Header HttpInterceptor
* Base Logger service
* Preload lazy-loading strategy
* EnsureModuleLoadedOnceGuard for Core module
* Generic Validator for Reactive Forms

## Additional Features

* Development APIs using json-server (edit data\db.json for API)

## Possible Future Features

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) integration
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) integration
* [Toastr](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/) integration

## Running the Application

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org. *IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need a current version of Node.js.*

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `npm run server` and `npm start` in seperate terminal windows -OR- run `npm run dev` to kick both off concurrently

1. Go to http://localhost:4200 in your browser
